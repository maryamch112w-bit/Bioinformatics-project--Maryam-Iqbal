Summary:
This project involves a comprehensive computational analysis of the Sesamum indicum FBD-associated F-box protein At4g13985-like (LOC105179901), transcript variant X2, following a full bioinformatics pipeline from DNA to protein interaction. Starting with the DNA sequence, the primary coding region (ORF) was identified and translated to reveal a protein sequence characterized by conserved F-box and Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domains. RNA analysis was performed to predict the stability of the mRNA secondary structure and identify key regulatory motifs within the 5’ and 3’ UTRs.
Physicochemical characterization provided insights into the protein's molecular weight, isoelectric point, and stability index, while subcellular localization tools predicted its functional site within the cell. To understand the evolutionary context, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using 6–10 homologous sequences, illustrating the relationship between this sesame F-box protein and its orthologs in other plant species. Finally, protein-protein interaction mapping via STRING was used to predict the functional network, highlighting its likely role as a substrate-recognition component within the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.

Tools used:
•  DNA Analysis: NCBI BLASTn, ORF Finder, ExPASy Translate.
•  RNA Analysis: UTRscan, RNAfold (ViennaRNA).
•  Protein Analysis: ProtParam, InterPro, Pfam.
•  Localization: PSORT, DeepLoc.
•  Phylogenetics: MEGA, Clustal Omega.
•  Interactions: STRING.
